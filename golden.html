  <h1>Golden Retrievers</h1>
	<div class="left">
	<p>The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, medium-large sized dog.
	The skull is broad and the muzzle is straight, tapering slightly with a well-defined stop.
	The nose is black or a brownish black.
	The teeth meet in a scissors bite.
	The medium to large eyes are dark brown. 
	The relatively short ears hang down close to the cheeks.
	When pulled forward the tip of the ear should just cover the eye.
	The tail is thick at the base with feathering along the underside.
	Dewclaws may be removed. The water-resistant coat is dense with a firm, straight or wavy outer coat.
	There is an untrimmed feathering on the underbelly, back of the legs, front of the neck and underside of the tail.
	Coat color comes in cream to a rich golden.</p>
	
	<p>These are lovable, <span style = "font-family: cursive">well-mannered, intelligent</span> dogs with a great charm.
	They are easily trained, and always patient and gentle with children.
	Charming, <span style = "color: red">devoted and self-assured, they are a popular family dog.</span>
	Energetic and loving, Golden Retrievers enjoy pleasing their masters, so obedience training can be very rewarding. 
	They excel in competitions. Friendly with everyone, including other dogs, the Golden Retriever has very little, if any, guarding instincts.
	While unlikely to attack, Goldens make <strong>good watchdogs, loudly signaling </strong>a stranger's approach.
	This<span style = "background-color: gray"> breed needs to be around people who display leadership </span>to be happy. 
	The Golden Retriever may become <em>destructive and/or high-strung, over-exuberant and distractible</em> if he is lacking in daily mental and physical exercise.
	Be sure to remain this dogâ€™s firm, but calm, confident, consistent pack leader to avoid behavioral issues. Some of the Golden's talents are hunting, tracking, retrieving, narcotics detection, agility, competitive obedience and performing tricks.
	These dogs also love to swim.
